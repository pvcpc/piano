- separate escape code parser from t_base.c into t_sequence.h/c

- separate color utilities/macros from t_sequence.h to t_draw.h/c,
  and simplify t_foreground_256 and t_background_256 to take in a
  uint8_t instead of int32_t w/o rgb compression (that should be done
  by a client.)

- play around with /dev/pts or /dev/tty* to see if we can support an
  applications with multiple input/output terminals to emulate
  multi-window displays.
	- This requires that subordinate terminals have no open reading
	  file descriptors (i.e., shells) as those split the user input 
	  stream into the shell's STDIN and whatever FD we have open
	  to read from. This might be an issue for many terminals.
